# Resume

Second project for Frontend Web Developer Nanodegree; my resume showcases my academic and professional history in a single page layout. Using jQuery to dynamically add HTML elements to the page, the resume is able to show information based on the javascript objects defined by the schema and is therefore not hardcoded onto the page. Additional Google map features were implemented to center the map based on which marker was clicked alongside a information window popup.
